# InfraSlueth

InfraSlueth is a collection of hunting rules to identify adversary infrastructure.

The scripts and rules powering this repository are maintained in a private repository, triggered by a daily scheduled GitHub Action.

To protect detection techniques, hunting rules will remain private.

The Python script used to run queries will be released once they are refined and presentable.
