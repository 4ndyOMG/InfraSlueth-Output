# InfraSlueth

InfraSlueth is a collection of hunting rules used to identify adversary infrastructure.

The scripts and rules powering this repository are maintained in a private repository, triggered by a scheduled GitHub Action.

To protect detection techniques the hunting rules will remain private.

The Python script powering this output will be released once refined.
